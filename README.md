# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements or needs of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the foundational steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). During this phase, software developers, project managers, and business analysts work collaboratively with stakeholders to ensure a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do.
It is a critical phase of the SDLC that directly impacts the success of a software project. By investing time and effort in this process, organizations can ensure that their software systems meet stakeholder expectations, align with business goals, and are delivered on time and within budget.
