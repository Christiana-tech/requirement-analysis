# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements or needs of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the foundational steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). During this phase, software developers, project managers, and business analysts work collaboratively with stakeholders to ensure a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do.
It is a critical phase of the SDLC that directly impacts the success of a software project. By investing time and effort in this process, organizations can ensure that their software systems meet stakeholder expectations, align with business goals, and are delivered on time and within budget.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that lays the foundation for a successful project. It involves gathering, analyzing, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders to ensure the developed solution meets its intended purpose. Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is vital:

### 1. Clarity and Alignment

Requirement Analysis provides a clear understanding of the project’s objectives, scope, and deliverables. It ensures that all stakeholders, including clients, developers, and end-users, are on the same page. This alignment reduces ambiguities and fosters effective communication, enabling teams to work towards a common goal.

### 2. Risk Mitigation and Cost Efficiency

By identifying potential challenges and constraints early in the development process, Requirement Analysis minimizes risks associated with misinterpretations or incomplete requirements. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of costly rework and delays, making the development process more efficient and predictable.

### 3. Enhanced Product Quality
Thorough Requirement Analysis ensures the final product meets user needs and expectations. By defining functional and non-functional requirements precisely, it lays the groundwork for building a high-quality solution that delivers value, improves user satisfaction, and aligns with business objectives.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of structured steps to define, document, and validate the needs of stakeholders. Below are the main steps:

### Requirement Gathering

- Conduct interviews with stakeholders.  
- Use surveys or questionnaires to gather broader input.  
- Organize workshops to brainstorm and clarify ideas.  
- Observe how users currently perform tasks.  
- Review existing documents and systems for insights.  

### Requirement Elicitation

- Host brainstorming sessions to collect ideas.  
- Form focus groups to explore specific requirements in depth.  
- Build prototypes to visualize and refine requirements.  

### Requirement Documentation

- Write a detailed specification document.  
- Create user stories that describe features from the user’s perspective.  
- Use diagrams to explain system interactions.  

### Requirement Analysis and Modeling

- Prioritize requirements based on importance.  
- Evaluate if each requirement is technically and financially feasible.  
- Use diagrams like data flows or Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to model the system.  

### Requirement Validation

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements can be broadly classified into two categories: Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements. Both are essential for defining the system’s behavior and ensuring its success. Below are definitions and examples specific to a booking management project.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the specific behavior, features, or functions of the system. They describe *what* the system should do to fulfill business objectives.  

#### Examples for a Booking Management Project:

- Users should be able to create, update, and cancel bookings.  
- The system must send confirmation emails to users after a successful booking.  
- Admins should be able to manage room availability and block dates for maintenance.  
- The system should allow users to search for available rooms by date and room type.  
- Payment processing must support credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets.  

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the *how* aspects of the system, such as performance, usability, reliability, and scalability. They define the quality attributes that the system must possess.

#### Examples for a Booking Management Project:

- The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.  
- Booking confirmation emails should be delivered within 30 seconds of a successful transaction.  
- The application interface should be responsive and load within 2 seconds on mobile devices.  
- The system should have a 99.9% uptime to ensure availability for users.  
- User data must be encrypted and comply with GDPR standards.  

---

By addressing both functional and non-functional requirements, the booking management project can ensure it meets user needs and delivers a high-quality experience.

- Review requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and completeness.  
- Define clear acceptance criteria to ensure requirements are met.  
- Track requirements to ensure they’re implemented correctly.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help in identifying and documenting system functionalities from a user's perspective. 

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

- Provide a high-level understanding of system requirements.  
- Identify the relationships between users and system features.  
- Facilitate communication among stakeholders and developers.  
- Serve as a guide for creating detailed design and test cases.

In summary, Requirement Analysis is the backbone of a successful software project, providing clarity, reducing risks, and enhancing the overall quality of the deliverable.
